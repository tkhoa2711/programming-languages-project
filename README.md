CPE425/CSC301
Programming Languages Project

The main objective of this assignment is to consolidate concepts related to various programming paradigms. While major concepts are covered as part of established theoretical concepts, the state of the art programming needs continuous update, and this assignment gives you an opportunity to have some hands-on experience for the same. You should also gain familiarity with object oriented programming paradigm (using C#), functional programming paradigm (using Scheme), and logic programming paradigm (using Prolog).
